        //Collections.sort(carList); this is not related to carComparator at all until we passed that in it
        //like Collections.sort(carList , carComparator); //here sort will not extend comparable
        //Collections.sort(carList) //but here sort must extend comparable because java does not know the how to sort
        //so it will take the default method

        //Collections.sort() defined in java 8 but after java 11 we have method like carList.sort(carComparator);
        //carList.sort(we have to pass here the sorting method like: carComparator)

//        âœ… Use of Comparable and Comparator in Java

         // more understandable
//        Comparator : it is mostly used for arranging multiple items a/c to any order u like.
//        Comparable : it will mandate , it will established a default method of comparison
//        one class can have only one comapreTo function but the object of the same class can be compared in
//        many-many manners with the help of comparator


//        Both are used for sorting objects in custom or default ways.
//         Comparable (natural order) //Natural/default sorting (inside the class)
//         Comparator (custom order) //Custom sorting (outside the class)

//        ðŸ”¹ Why do we need them?
//         In Java, if you create your own class (like Student, Employee, etc.),
//         Java doesnâ€™t know how to compare two objects of that class.
//         To sort a list of such objects, you must define the sorting logic.


        //Interview questions : how u can sort an object using the stream

        List<Car> streamCarList = carList.stream()
                                  .filter(c-> c.price>600000)
                                  .sorted((car1,car2)->{
                                      return (int) (car2.price - car1.price);
                                  })
                                  .toList();

    }
